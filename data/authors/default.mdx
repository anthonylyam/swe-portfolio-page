I'm a full-stack developer, a lifelong learner, and a collaborative teammate.

At my core, I'm an architect â€“ I love designing and building: whether it's software solutions, robust financial understanding, or communities.

Beyond code and numbers, I'm passionate about self-introspection, reflecting on life's lessons, and sharing my discoveries with those around me.
